### 문제 설명

<p>Peter's business is flagging so he has been looking for a way to improve sales. His latest idea is a “buy three get one free” type scheme. He is hoping that special offers like this will encourage customers into his shop.</p>

<p>Your job is to write a program to help Peter by making it easier for customers to know how much they can save.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a number of product scenarios. A scenario begins with the name of the product on a line of its own. The name consists of 1 or more words which will be separated by spaces. The final line contains a product name consisting of a single # symbol; do not process this product.</p>

<p>The second line of each product scenario consists of two integers, PD and PC (0 <= PD <= 50, 0 <= PC <= 99), separated by a space, which is the price per item of the product in dollars and cents respectively. PD and PC will not both be zero.</p>

<p>The third line of each product scenario consists of an integer, D (0 < D <= 10) on a line of its own being the number of deals available for this product.</p>

<p>The number is followed by D lines, each line being two integers B and F. (0 < B F <= 100) separated by a space. B is the number of products that must be bought and F is the number available free if this number is bought.</p>

<p>The next line is another single number, E (0 < E <= 30) on a line of its own being the number of examples to follow.</p>

<p>The number is followed by E lines each containing a single positive integer less than 500. Each number represents a quantity of items to be purchased. You have to use the available deals to work out the best saving the customer can make. Note that in calculating the best deal, a customer does not have to take all the free items offered.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output consists of a section for each product. The section starts with the name of the product on a line of its own. This line is followed by E lines, one for each example in the input. Each line will be of the format</p>

<pre>Buy N, save $D</pre>

<p>N is the number of items bought and D is the amount saved compared to having no free items. The amount D will be in the format</p>

<pre>d.dd</pre>

<p>That is there will be at least one digit for the dollars, a decimal point and two digits for the cents.</p>

<p>A blank line separates each product section.</p>
