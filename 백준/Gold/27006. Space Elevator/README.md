### 문제 설명

<p>The cows are going to space! They plan to achieve orbit by building a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks. They have K (1 ≤ K ≤ 400) different types of blocks with which to build the tower. Each block of type i has height h_i (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 100) and is available in quantity c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10). Due to possible damage caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a maximum altitude a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 40000).</p>

<p>Help the cows build the tallest space elevator possible by stacking blocks on top of each other according to the rules.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer, K</li>
	<li>Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers: h_i, a_i, and c_i. Line i+1 describes block type i.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer H, the maximum height of a tower that can be built</li>
</ul>
