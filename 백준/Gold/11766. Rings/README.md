### 문제 설명

<p>Dee Siduous is a botanist who specializes in trees. A lot of her research has to do with the formation of tree rings, and what they say about the growing conditions over the tree’s lifetime. She has a certain theory and wants to run some simulations to see if it holds up to the evidence gathered in the field.</p>

<p>One thing that needs to be done is to determine the expected number of rings given the outline of a tree. Dee has decided to model a cross section of a tree on a two dimensional grid, with the interior of the tree represented by a closed polygon of grid squares. Given this set of squares, she assigns rings from the outer parts of the tree to the inner as follows: calling the non-tree grid squares “ring 0”, each ring n is made up of all those grid squares that have at least one ring (n − 1) square as a neighbor (where neighboring squares are those that share an edge).</p>

<p>An example of this is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>Most of Dee’s models have been drawn on graph paper, and she has come to you to write a program to do this automatically for her. This way she’ll use less paper and save some . . . well, you know.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input will start with a line containing two positive integers n m specifying the number of rows and columns in the tree grid, where n, m ≤ 100. After this will be n rows containing m characters each. These characters will be either ‘T’ indicating a tree grid square, or ‘.’.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a grid with the ring numbers. If the number of rings is less than 10, use two characters for each grid square; otherwise use three characters for each grid square. Right justify all ring numbers in the grid squares, and use ‘.’ to fill in the remaining characters.</p>

<p>If a row or column does not contain a ring number it should still be output, filled entirely with ‘.’s.</p>
