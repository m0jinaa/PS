Each data set begins with a line containing the number N of the remaining lines in the dataset (1 ≤ N ≤ 500), followed by a space, followed by the name of a departure town, followed by a space, followed by the name of a destination town. Each of these N lines contains a name of a departure town, followed by a space, followed by a name of a destination town, followed by the distance (in kilometers) between the two towns. The distance will be an integer and the name of town will be a string formed with characters [a-z] [A-Z] and with the sign “-”.</p>
