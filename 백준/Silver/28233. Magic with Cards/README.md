### 문제 설명

<p>Mahsa has been practicing shuffling cards for a few months now. Tonight, she finally decided to invite her friends over and show off her new skills. So she picks up a deck with 2n cards, shows her friends the face of the cards whithout changing the deck order and asks someone to pick two positions i and j in the deck. Then, she tells everyone that she is going to move the card in the i-th position to the j-th position by applying only two types of shuffles.</p>

<p>Assume the cards in the deck are ⟨c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ..., c<sub>2n</sub>⟩. Mahsa can perform these two shuffles as many times as she wants:</p>

<p><strong>Riffle</strong>: Divide the cards into two parts⟨c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ..., c<sub>n</sub>⟩ and ⟨c<sub>n+1</sub>, ..., c<sub>2n</sub>⟩ and produce ⟨c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>n+1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>n+2</sub>, ..., c<sub>n</sub>, c<sub>2n</sub>⟩.</p>

<p><strong>Scuffle</strong>: From ⟨c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ..., c<sub>2n</sub>⟩, produce ⟨c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>4</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>, ..., c<sub>2n</sub>, c<sub>2n-1</sub>⟩.</p>

<p>Help Mahsa find out the minimum number of shuffles she needs, and she’ll figure out the rest.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing three space-separated integers n, i and j (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 10<sup>5</sup> and 1 ⩽ i, j ⩽ 2n).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print a single integer, the minimum number of shuffles required to bring the i-th card to j-th position. If it is not possible to do so, print -1 instead.</p>
